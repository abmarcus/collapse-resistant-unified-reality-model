ONE-PAGE ANALYTIC SUMMARY  
Grand Unified Theory of Reality (GUT-R)

Title:  
A Substrate-Agnostic, Collapse-Resistant Framework for Modeling Reality Across Ontological Domains

Summary:  
GUT-R is a generative, structurally stable metaphysical-epistemic model that withstands collapse from paradox, recursion, simulation framing, and ontological reduction. It arises from the axiom “Hoc, ergo aliquid” (“This, therefore something”)—a minimal, irreducible act of reference that requires no assumptions, only differentiation.

Key Features:
- Collapse-resistant under adversarial testing
- Multilayer ontological structure (physical, symbolic, cognitive, abstract)
- Operates across simulation, solipsism, and material conditions without contradiction
- Self-reflective; includes its own meta-theoretic conditions
- Alignment-relevant: applicable to agent modeling, recursive oversight, epistemic drift control

Relevance:
- Suitable for AI alignment and truth-preserving agent architectures
- Useful in epistemic infrastructure security and simulation integrity design
- Provides a generative ground for all coherent ontological systems

Status:
- Phase 1 release with timestamped authorship chain
- Formal endorsement and collapse audit attached
- Authorship withheld for now; available upon inquiry
