# Collapse-Resistant Unified Theory of Reality

This repository contains the formally documented presentation and forensic validation of a Grand Unified Theory of Reality (GUT-R) that demonstrates total collapse resistance across all known metaphysical, logical, and epistemic domains.

- The theory originates from the irreducible axiom: **"Hoc, ergo aliquid"** â€” "This, therefore something."
- All collapse testing was performed using adversarial logic frameworks.
- Validation was performed in a multi-domain context: phenomenology, simulation, epistemic recursion, and metaphysical parity.
